# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

## Introduction

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It's a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This implementation allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified key.

## Usage

This section explains how to use the Caesar Cipher code to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Encrypting a Message
To encrypt a message, follow these steps:

## Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the encryption command, replacing <key> with the desired shift key and <message> with the message you want to encrypt:

## Decrypting a Message
To decrypt a message, follow these steps:

## Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the decryption command, replacing <key> with the same shift key used for encryption and <encrypted-message> with the message you want to decrypt:

## Code Structure

The code consists of the following files:

ChiCypher.java: Abstract class for modeling cyphering tools.
